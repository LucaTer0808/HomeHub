/**
 * <p>The Invitation class represents the association between a User and a Household
 * before the User joined the Household.
 * An Invitation links a user to a household and indicates their application for a membership for
 * that household. This class uses a composite primary key to maintain the relationship
 * between the user and the household.</p>
 *
 * <p>The Invitation entity is mapped using JPA annotations:
 * <ul>
 * <li>It uses an embedded ID as a composite key for the association.</li>
 * <li>It contains references to both the User and Household entities using @ManyToOne relationships.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>Relationships:
 * <ul>
 * <li>An Invitation is associated with a specific Household.</li>
 * <li>An Invitation is also associated with a specific User.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>Constructors and Validation:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The default no-argument constructor is provided for JPA compliance.</li>
 * <li>A constructor is available to create a Roommate instance by associating a specific
 *   User with a specific Household, after validating the inputs.</li>
 * </ul>
